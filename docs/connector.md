# Connector

iCal4j Connector is an extension library that provides support for connecting to back-end calendar/vCard servers. Initial support includes connecting to CalDAV- and CardDAV-compliant servers, as well as Java Content Repository (JCR) implementations.

## Minimum requirements

iCal4j Connector requires a minimum of Java 5 due to the use of features introduced in this version. If you need to run on an earlier version of Java, consider using [Retroweaver](http://retroweaver.sourceforge.net).
